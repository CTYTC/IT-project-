A powerful media management -- Cloudinary is used to store images. With Cloudinary, images could be uploaded to the storage safely and easily. Also, while uploading, transformation could also be handled to crop images. Every image that stored in Cloudinary would have a url and public id, which could be stored in our database. While using the images, we access the database to get the url and id, and then getting the images with them. In this way, although all images are stored in the same bucket, they could be seperated by database table. 
We display images and articles ine the way of waterfall wall, which makes it look nice and beautiful.
