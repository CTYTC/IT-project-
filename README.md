  The front end uses two attributes to track the statue of user login, userLogin and Authentication. UserLogin represents   if user has logined in. Authentication stored in the local storage contains the information for backend to verify if     user's login state is valid. When user firstly login, the backend will return a token which should be stored as           Authentication. After user logining out, the userLogin will be false and Authentication will be empty.
